  "transcript": "Hi Sarah, thanks for calling DreamSeed. I'm excited to help you start your business! So tell me, what's the business idea you want to pursue? Well, I want to start a consulting business helping small restaurants improve their operations and profitability. I've been working in restaurant management for 15 years and I see so many places struggling with inefficient processes. That sounds like a great opportunity! What would you like to call this business? I'm thinking Restaurant Success Solutions or maybe Culinary Operations Consulting. I like the first one better. Perfect! And what state are you looking to file your LLC in? I'm in California, so probably there. Is that the best choice? We can definitely explore that. Now for contact information - what's the best email and phone number to reach you? My email is sarah.johnson@email.com and my cell is 555-123-4567.",
