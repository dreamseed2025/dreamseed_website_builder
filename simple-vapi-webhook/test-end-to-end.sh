I have been working in restaurant management for 15 years and I see so many places struggling with inefficient processes. I want to call this business Restaurant Success Solutions. I am in California, so I would like to file my LLC there. My email is sarah.johnson@email.com and my cell is 555-123-4567. I have about $25,000 saved up to get started and I am hoping to launch within the next 3 months.",

I want to come across as professional but approachable, knowledgeable but not intimidating. I want restaurant owners to feel like I understand their struggles. For colors, I am drawn to warm, earthy tones - maybe deep greens and warm grays. I want it to feel stable and trustworthy but also fresh and modern. For my logo, I think I would like an icon with the text, maybe something that suggests growth or efficiency. My main competitors are big consulting firms that work with restaurant chains, but they are expensive and impersonal. What makes me different is my 15 years of hands-on restaurant management experience - I have actually run day-to-day operations. I want my main website message to be something like Turn your restaurant passion into sustainable profit.",
